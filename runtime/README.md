Runtime
===

Contains helpful runtime scripts.  All `.gnu` files are run by [`gnuplot`](http://brewformulas.org/Gnuplot) as

    gnuplot gnufile.gnu

which can be installed through [`homebrew`](http://brew.sh/) as

    brew install gnuplot

`gnuplot` is much faster than `matpotlib` and therefore a viable solution for plotting regular live updates to large datasets
