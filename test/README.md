Test Files
---

These files test each of the constituent models with the simple `MNIST` handwriting repository.

Tests are based on examples at [`DeepLearning.net`](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/) and results can be directly compared to demonstrate the code is functioning as expected.

# Running Tests
